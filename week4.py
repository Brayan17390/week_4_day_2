# Advanced Problem Set: Delving Deeper with Numbers in Python --- Bell Ringer

#################### PROBLEM 1: Basic Arithmetic & Order of Operations ####################
# Task 1: Using the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), evaluate the following expression:
# 3 + 6 * (5 + 4) / 3 - 7. Print the result.
print(3 + 6 * (5 + 4) / 3 - 7)
# Task 2: Calculate the remainder when 145 is divided by 12 using modulo and print the result.
print(145%12)
# Task 3: Raise 7 to the power of 3 and print the result.
print(7**3)
#################### PROBLEM 2: Working with Functions ####################
# Task 4: Given a list of numbers:
numbers = [23, 89, 12, 54, 92, 65, 71, 13, 45]
# Use the max() and min() functions to find the highest and lowest number respectively.
print (max(23, 89, 12, 54, 92, 65, 71, 13, 45))
print(min(23, 89, 12, 54, 92, 65, 71, 13, 45))
# Task 5: Round the number 12.5678 to 2 decimal places.
print(round(12.5678,2))
# Task 6: Find the absolute value of -45.
print (abs(-45))
#################### PROBLEM 3: Advanced Math Functions ####################
from math import *

# Task 7: Using the math library, find the floor value of 15.7.
print(floor(15.7))
# Task 8: Find the ceiling value of 15.2.
print (ceil(15.2))
# Task 9: Calculate the square root of 625.
print(sqrt(625))
#################### PROBLEM 4: Problem Solving ####################
# Task 10: You are given two lists:
prices = [34.56, 45.78, 23.89, 12.34, 78.90]
print(sum(prices))
quantities = [3, 5, 2, 4, 6]
print(sum(quantities))
# Calculate the total cost for each item (price multiplied by quantity).
# Then, find the average cost of all items after rounding it to 2 decimal places.
